# CSCI220_ComputerProgrammingI

This is a repository of all my course work up to this point. I'm open to all suggestions on improving and advancing 
the code or ideas on how to apply the code and concepts on a larger scale. I strive to make my code unbreakable and
futureproof whenever possible, so once again if there's anything I missed don't hesistate to bring it up to my attention.
